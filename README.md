# 🩺 TBC Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project aims to detect **Tuberculosis (TBC)** from chest X-ray images using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model can learn patterns in X-ray images and classify whether a patient is likely infected with TBC or not.
